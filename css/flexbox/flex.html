        This property is the shorthand for the flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis properties.
        Among other values it also can be set to auto (1 1 auto) and none (0 0 auto).

        flex-glow  空间充足时，指定剩余空间的分配
        This property specifies the flex grow factor,
        which determines how much the flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container
        when positive free space is distributed.

        flex-shrink 空间不足时，指定缩放比例
        The flex-shrink specifies the flex shrink factor,
        which determines how much the flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container
        when negative free space is distributed.

        flex-basic 容器空间减去该属性指定的空间，才是剩余空间。当剩余空间为正数时，按照flex-glow分配。当剩余空间为负数时,按照flex-shrink缩放。
        This property takes the same values as the width and height properties,
        and specifies the initial main size of the flex item, before free space is distributed according to the flex factors.
